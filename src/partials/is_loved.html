            I love this chocolate bar. Perfect combination of light crispy
            wafer, covered in a thin layer chocolate.

            This chocolate confection is a delight! A delight! The wafer is
            light and crisp, the hazelnut cream is smooth, and the chocolate is

            Chocolate is a family favourite treat. Love the delicious smooth
            chocolate and the creaminess inside. The wafer is soft but crunchy.

            The chocolate assortment was delicious. Both dark and milk chocolate

            This is delicious. It so rich and flavorful you donâ€™t need to use as
            many. I love topping an apple with almond butter and these chips for
            a snack.
